        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a background in computer science and the U.S. Air Force. I specialize in building clean, scalable web applications using tools like React, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS. My experience as an F-16 mechanic and military team leader sharpened my attention to detail, discipline, and problem-solving â€” qualities I bring into every line of code.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
          I thrive in fast-paced environments, love solving real-world problems through code, and enjoy collaborating with teams to bring ideas to life. My goal is to join a company where I can grow as a developer, contribute meaningfully, and build technology that makes a difference.
